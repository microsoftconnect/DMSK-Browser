        <h2>Solved issues in service release 19</h2>
        <p>In Microsoft Internet Explorer 9, the cursor no longer jumps to the end of the field when recording is started. [DNB-2655, DNB-2598]</p>
        <p>In Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, the cursor is no longer in an incorrect position after typing &lt;Enter&gt; between two dictations. [DNB-1867]</p>
        <p>Manually changing the focus to another speech-enabled field no longer results in recognition inaccuracies in the next utterance. [DNB-2575]</p>
        <p>Network connection reliability has been improved. [DNB-1476]</p>
        <p>The user can now select text via voice in a text control that has the voice focus, but not the GUI focus. [DNB-1859]</p>
        <p>The <span class="command">undo that</span> voice command now works properly in single line fields. [DNB-1449]</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> For information on previous  service releases, see <a href="#SR_History">below</a>.</p>
        <h2>Important information in version 1.6</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>In order to take advantage of these improvements, 360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.6 SR 10 Server is highly recommended with this version of the Browser edition.</li>
            <li>360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.6 Server is compatible with client versions 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6.</li>
            <li>360 | SpeechAnywhere Services 1.6 Browser edition is compatible with server versions 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6.</li>
            <li>Do not change or hide GUI elements. Changing or hiding GUI elements risks the stability and compatibility of the SDK and Nuance cannot provide support for such integrations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>New in version 1.6</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Voice editing functionality has been extended with select &amp; say voice commands (Dragon-based systems only).</li>
            <li>Text formatting has been improved. When text is inserted, the spacing is correctly updated and surrounding text is correctly capitalized (Dragon-based systems only).</li>
            <li>SAS clients can now use Dragon customization packs (.dat files) containing Text-and-Graphics/auto-texts without lists. You can import and share .dat files via the Nuance Management Console.</li>
            <li>SAS Browser edition has a new method to start recording: <code>NUSA_startRecording()</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Known issues</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>In Internet Explorer 11 the cursor position is incorrect after copied text has been pasted in. [DNB-1434]</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>On OS X, speech recognition can be temporarily unavailable after switching between browsers. <b>Solution:</b> Refresh the page. [PSP00070425]</li>
            <li>Internet Explorer: SAS Browser edition does not work correctly with Compatibility View turned on. <b>Solution:</b> Turn off Compatibility View. [DNB-1457, DNB-1458]</li>
            <li>The <code>SpokenText</code> parameter in the <code>CommandRecognized</code> event is empty in command mode. [DNB-328]</li>

        <ul>
            <li>The Record button does not work on MacBook via Safari browser. Workaround: For the Silverlight plugin, activate <b>Run in Unsafe Mode</b> in the <b>Manage Website Settings</b> (via the <b>Preferences</b> menu, <b>Security</b>, tab of the Safari browser). [DNB-1423]</li>

        <h3>*End-of-life: third party environments</h3>
        <p>Support for third party environments is only valid as long as they are supported by the corresponding vendor and might be subject to other restrictions. Please contact Nuance Technical Support for details. For more information, see the documentation delivered with the third party product and supporting Nuance documentation.</p>
        <p>When support by the vendor has stopped, Nuance will continue support if an issue is specific to the Nuance solution, within the limitations of the vendor’s end-of-life and Nuance's policy. This means that issues that are a combination of the vendor’s component and the Nuance solution cannot be supported.</p>
